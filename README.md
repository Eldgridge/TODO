# Getting started

See the article [Installing Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html) to make sure your development environment is prepared properly.

## Use RVM

I recommend using [rvm](https://rvm.io/), the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, you can create a project-specific gemset.

## Install the Required Gems

If you used the Rails Composer tool to generate the example app, the application template script has already run the bundle install command.

If not, you should run the bundle install command to install the required gems on your computer:
```
$ bundle install
```
You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:
```
$ gem list
```
